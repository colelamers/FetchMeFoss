# FetchMeFoss
Working app. Getting real tired of finding all the webpages and downloading the foss related apps I need when I have to do a fresh install of windows. After the billionth time, it gets tedious. May and or may not jump ship to Linux, but for Windows 10's lifespan I plan on using this...maybe longer :)
